Hi, I’m @YelloShmalien.

I’m interested in becoming a Front-End Engineer and, eventually, a Full-Stack Developer as well if a chance for it presents itself.
I’m currently learning Intermediate CSS on Codecademy. I hope to complete the Front-End Engineer Skill Path there by the end of the year.

I used to work as a media/graphic and UI/UX designer for an e-learning agency with their own authoring tool.
I've always been interested in coding and, over the years, have dabbled in content creation which required me to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
I have styled not only entire CSS design themes for my work place's authoring tool but also for several moodle sites. 

I am also an illustrator specialised in character design.
